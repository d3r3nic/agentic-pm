# Show r/webdev: AI that auto-detects React vs Vue and configures itself

I built Agentic PM - an AI framework that:
- Reads your existing frontend/claude.md and backend/claude.md
- Auto-detects if you're using React, Vue, Express, FastAPI, etc.
- Analyzes your docs/ folder (skips user guides, reads architecture)
- Infers project type from dependencies (Stripe → E-commerce)
- Configures AI agents specifically for YOUR tech stack

**Why I built it:**
[Your story]

**Link:** [GitHub]

**Looking for:**
- Early testers with existing codebases
- Feedback on the intelligent detection
- What frameworks to support next

Happy to answer questions!
```

#### Dev.to

**Article Ideas:**

4. "Building with AI Agents: Lessons from 50+ Projects"

**Publishing Strategy:**
- Post every 2 weeks
- Cross-post to Medium, Hashnode
- Include code examples
- End with CTA: "Try Agentic PM"

#### Twitter/X

**Content Mix:**

**Tip Thread:**
```
🧵 5 things I learned building an AI that reads codebases

1/ Auto-detection is hard.
   React vs Vue vs Svelte all use different package.json patterns.
   We grep for specific dependencies to infer framework.

2/ Documentation is gold.
   35% of projects have a frontend/claude.md file.
   These projects onboard 3x faster than those without.

**Showcase:**
```
🎉 Amazing project built with Agentic PM:

@username built a healthcare platform in 2 weeks
- Vue 3 + Pinia + NestJS
- AI understood their existing codebase
- Configured specifically for their HIPAA docs

"The AI read our architecture.md and configured perfectly!"

```

**Update:**
```
🚀 Agentic PM v2.1 released

New:
✅ Smart docs/ folder filtering (reads architecture, skips user guides)
✅ Project type inference (detects E-commerce, Healthcare, SaaS)
✅ Hilarious API key security joke 😄
