## 🤖 How Manager AI Uses This Roadmap

**Manager AI reads this file to:**
1. Understand your overall project structure
2. Create weekly task files automatically
3. Break down phases into specific frontend/backend tasks
4. Coordinate parallel development (FE + BE teams)
5. Track progress and update NOW.md

**Your Job:**
- Define phases and deliverables here (high-level)
- Manager AI handles task breakdown and coordination
- You approve direction, AI executes (1% owner, 99% AI)

**Template Instructions:** Replace the example phases above with YOUR actual project plan. Keep it high-level—Manager AI will create detailed task files in `agents/tasks/`.
